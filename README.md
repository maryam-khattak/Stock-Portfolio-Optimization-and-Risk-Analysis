# Stock-Portfolio-Optimization-and-Risk-Analysis
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of portfolio allocations for five selected stocks, focusing on optimizing returns while managing risk. Utilized statistical models to assess asset volatility and employed techniques like Value at Risk (VaR) and beta analysis to provide insights into the risk-return profile of the portfolio.

# Key Components:
• Developed and optimized portfolio allocations using Excel Solver for effective asset distribution.  
• Analyzed stock volatility through ARCH/GARCH models to understand the impacts on portfolio performance.  
• Implemented various risk assessment measures, including Value at Risk (VaR) and beta analysis, to evaluate the potential for losses in investment.  
• Utilized RStudio for data analysis and visualization to present findings and insights effectively.  

# Technologies Used:
**Languages**: R  
**Libraries**: gamlss, MASS, fitdistrplus, ggplot2, quantmod, openxlsx  
**Tools**: Excel Solver, Excel Data Analysis, RStudio  

# Benefits:
This project provided a deeper understanding of portfolio management and optimization techniques, enhancing my ability to assess and mitigate risks through advanced statistical modeling. By analyzing asset returns and volatility, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics of investment choices, which informed more strategic decision-making. The skills developed during this project are applicable to real-world investment scenarios, allowing for improved risk-return profiles in future portfolio management efforts.
